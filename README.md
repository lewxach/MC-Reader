MC-Reader is a Python library for reading various files within a Minecraft world, such as `.mca`, `.dat`, and `session.lock` files. It allows easy access to Minecraft world data by automatically locating and parsing these files.

## Features

- Parses `.dat` files from `/data`, `/DIM1/data`, `/DIM-1/data`, and `/playerdata`.
- Supports reading the `level.dat` file and `session.lock` file.
- Easy access to Minecraft world data using the player's Minecraft username.

## Installation

You can install MC-Reader via pip:

## Downsides

I'm too lazy to make like docs docs, you can make some if you want though.
Sorry!
